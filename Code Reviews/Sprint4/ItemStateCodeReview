Readabiliity Review- Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The variable and method names are easy to understand in IItemState. There are comments that help in 
some places, you could add more or an overall comment at the header to explain the file. 

Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
There are some methods like MoveUp/MoveDown/MoveRight/MoveLeft in ItemAngelState could be made into 
a method since some of the code is repeated. I think using these for UseItem in the inventory is 
well organized. Great job!
