Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
- Easy to understand and few hardcoded numbers and strings
- potentially use enums to avoid strings
- Easy to see what will be drawn for each game state
