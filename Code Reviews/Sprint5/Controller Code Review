Readabiliity Review- 
MouseController is very easy to understand
Keyboard Controller could use some more comments and delete old comments but is not hard to understand

Code Quality Review-  
KeyboardController: Good use of XML with distinction between press and hold commands as well as player distinct commands.
                    Command list is a good idea to have a key be able to be used for multiple commands.
                    The loops in update could be combined into one loop, could potentially help with performance.

MouseController: This might not be needed anymore so it can potentially be deleted
