A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change: Honestly, nothing major needs to be changed. If anything, making it more similar to 
the keyboard controller, where we simply do a for each loop for all sounds that need to be played could shorten the code even more. 
Otherwise, everything else is fantastic
