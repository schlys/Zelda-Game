Readabiliity Review: 

Overall, variable names and method names are easy to understand.
For better readability, need to remove unuseful annotations.

Overall, all codes are high cohesion and low coupling.
There are not any magic numbers.
Some .cs files have unused private methods such as StopMoving method EnemyStateGel.cs, so they are needed to be deleted.
