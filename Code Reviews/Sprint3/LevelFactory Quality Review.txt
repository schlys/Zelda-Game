A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
- Change the siwtch case into a jump table or use reflection if possible
- LevelFactory does a lot of different things, maybe parts of it could be moved into their own class
- Good use of rectangles to simplify bounds methods
