Sprint number: 3
Number of Minutes: 15
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CollisionManager.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Sam, Chaeun
Specific comments on code quality:
very long class, class has many responsibilites/methods,  magic numbers, 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
maybe have separate classses for various methods: CreateDict(make collision factory), Add/Remove Object, DetectCollisions class, 
maybe instead of checking for "noCmd" just check for empty string to avoid string literaals
