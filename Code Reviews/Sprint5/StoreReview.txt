Readability Review: File lacks comments, save for one note to change item prices. The draw method is quite long, and confusing, as the number of
magic numbers combined with no comments makes it difficult to understand what the values mean. Other than that, the rest of the file is easy to
read and understand.
quite well.
Quality Review: Firstly, I'm unsure if the update and reset functions are simply obsolete or just unfinished, but they need to be dealt with.
Second, I'm confused as to why there are three purchase item methods instead of one that checks if any of the three items have been bought.
Finally, the item prices need to be finalized, which is noted.
