Our team planned effectively and met regularly to remain on task. One of our teammates, Jake, 
was very ill throughout the majority of this timeframe and could not contribute. But, our 
remaining five members were still able to stay on task. We met after class Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday to discuss our progress. We also had discord calls some of the days we did not have 
class. We used ZenHub to plan and Discord to communicate. 

We began by creating the framework of the project: making basic interfaces and classes for the 
base objects. We focused on specific parts like the controller and commands, Link, 
Items, Block, or Enemys. We decided to use states for the variations of most of the objects. 
For instance, Link has a seperate weapon and direction state. After we had the framework 
complete, we began working on animating the game. We created a single Sprite Factory and 
Sprite class to mange our animations. One of our teammates uniformly laid out all of our 
spritesheets. Our sprites are loaded from an XML file. Sprites are accessed from the factory 
with a specific string key. Lastly, we worked onanimating projectiles for Link and the Enemys. 
In the future, we need to refactor this code more. 

We got started as soon as possible and did not procrastinate which aided out process. We could 
have alloted more time for the difficult task of projectiles and animation. In the future, 
we hope to continue effectively planning for our sprints.
