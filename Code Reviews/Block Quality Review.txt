Code Quality Review-  

- the Game parameter is never used and should be removed 

PrevBlock() and NextBlock methods: 

- group the switch case from these methods into a single method to reduce duplicated code. 
This could be done by passing the index as a parameter, and the method would change the 
BlockState. 

- group the increment changes to counter from these methods into a single method to reduce 
duplicated code. You could pass the step to reduce/increase it by as a parameter. 

(See Item.cs for similar implementations of both of the above)

- create a step field rather than using the magic number 0.2
