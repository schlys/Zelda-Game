Readabiliity Review- Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
- determining the hitbox in the constructor uses a long arithmitic statement that includes Math.Floor. I don't know what this does and a comment would be useful. 
- this same statement uses a few hard coded numbers that should be assigned to variables. 
- property names are clear and understandable 
- method bodies not too long 

Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
- this implements IProjectile but fails to use implement multiple of IProjectiles methods. I think it could be better suited elsewhere, perhaps in Link. It would still implement ICollidable but not IProjetile. In Link, you would have a weapon item that is either this, or an empty rectangle. 
- too many hardcoded integers 
- need default case in the switch statement
