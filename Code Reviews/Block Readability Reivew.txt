Readabiliity Review- Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
- parameter names BlockState and counter are descriptive and readable 
- parameter ID is vague and should be changed to something like BlockStateKeys since it's describing the keys for the sprite factory 
- PrevBlock() and NextBlock() use a magic number to increment which should be changed to a field 
- could add an overall comment to describe the purpose of the file
