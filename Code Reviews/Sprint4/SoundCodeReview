Readabiliity Review- Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The file is very readable and well organized. The method names are logical. 

Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
You could make the keys used in the sound methods a variable so you have the hard coded strings in 
one place. You could also use the TryAdd method when accessing the dictionary to safeguard in case 
the key is not found. Overall, great job!
