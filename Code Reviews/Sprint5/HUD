Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
vector name variables are readable, names of text sprites could be more descripitve, texture variables are clear. constructor is somewhat readable, datadriving may help to shorten and clear it up. 

Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
DrawHud method is very long and includes many subparts. maybe break it up into more methods to draw each specific part of the hud. overall good!
