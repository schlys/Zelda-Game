Readabiliity Review- 
Many commands are repetitive though this may be unavoidable, command objects are short and easy to understand 
There could be more comments but again, the commands are very easy to understand.

Code Quality Review-  
Good to have a null command object.
Low coupling and logic going on in Execute methods which is good.
