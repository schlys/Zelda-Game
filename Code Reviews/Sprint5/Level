Readabiliity Review- Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
all variables clearly named, constructor is clear, create dict is very long, overall very readable and understandable

Code Quality Review-  A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file
being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
nested for loops to read from different xml files - separate the loops into two separate loops?, not sure if this would make logical sense but the class is very long and contains a lot of methods - maybe creating a separate into a separate class with movement and scrolling between levels.
