Our team planned effectively and met regularly to remain on task. We met after class Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday to discuss our progress and assign various tasks. We also had discord 
calls some of the days we did not have class to update eachother. We used ZenHub to plan
and Discord to communicate. 

We began by creating a plan for completing sprint, focusing on collisions and levels. We 
determined all aspects of collisions and levels that needed to be completed and added them 
to zenhub. We then assigned tasks to people based on what people were interested in working on.

We got started as soon as possible and did not procrastinate which aided our process. We also had
strong communication. We messaged with updates on what we were working on and what we need help with.
We always message everytime we push with whatwas just completed. We also have subgroup chats for 
specfic tasks(people working on collision, people working on levels, etc). 

We could have more evenly split up the work, we had to switch people around tasks last minite 
because some people were assigned a lot of work. We also could have created a more clear outline 
of what the sprint should have by the end and made sure the most important aspects are completed first.
We also should have created stronger mini deadlines within the sprint to stay on track and hold people more
accountable for the work.
