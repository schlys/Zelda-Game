Sprint Number: 5
Name of file: Game1.cs
Author(s) of file:  Elise Kosmides, Sam Chlystek, Chaeun Hong
Number of minutes taken: 5 minutes
Readability Review: The file is lacking any comments, but seeing as though it is structured quite well, and easy to understand, I don't think
comments would be necessary. The many game state methods are a little disorganized, but ulitmately it doesn't negatively impact readibility. 
In summation, the file is quite easy to navigate and read, seeing as though it's been here since Sprint 2, and hence has been refined and cleaned
quite well.
Quality Review: I have nothing to contribute on the quality of the file because it has been refactored so aggresively to the point where there
is no fluff, no room for change, or any critiques neccesary.
