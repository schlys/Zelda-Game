Readabiliity Review- 
Collision, NullCollision, & ICollision: understandable variable names, short method bodys, simple 
CollisionManager - could add comments to clarify purpose of methods. methods short with minimal duplicate code. 

Code Quality Review-  
NullCollision - good use of a null object 
CollisionManger - some methods are long and could be simplified. change if else in detectcollisions to something more effective?
