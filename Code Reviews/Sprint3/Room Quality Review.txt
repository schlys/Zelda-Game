A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
-First, we will need to respec the room dimensions to fit the 16:9 ratio of the sprites in order to properly size the room
-Second, what purpose does reset hold? I assume it's a function for this sprint, but the room doesn't need an inherent reset function for the finished game
