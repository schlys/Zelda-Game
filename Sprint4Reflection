Our team planned effectively and met 3 times a week to stay on task. We met after class Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday to discuss our progress, assign tasks, and brainstorm ideas. We also had discord 
calls some of the days we did not have class to update eachother. We used ZenHub to plan
and Discord to communicate. 

We began by creating a plan for completing sprint. We added all tasks that needed to be completed for 
the sprint to zenhub. We then assigned tasks to each person based on people's interests. We made sure 
the bigger tasks like HUD, States, and Room Scrolling had multiple people assigned to it. 

We got started the day the sprint was assigned. We also had strong communication throughout the week. 
We messaged with updates on what we were working on and what we need help with.
We always message everytime we push with what was just completed. We also have subgroup chats for 
specfic tasks to coordinate who should work on what. 

We could have created stricter deadlines for subtasks. We often let one of the main tasks for the sprint 
forgotten about, which causes a lot of work last minute.
